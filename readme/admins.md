# Admin Setup
Within the /config/nginx folder, there is a .htpasswd file, this file is where you would add or edit the credentials for admin protected routes. This file stores username:encryptedpassword pairs. Use a website such as [this one](https://www.web2generators.com/apache-tools/htpasswd-generator) to generate new passwords for adding to the file..


The default admin credentials are as follows;
- UserName: PalHUB
- PassWord: PassHUB

This should be configured before you allow your server to be publicly accessable!!
